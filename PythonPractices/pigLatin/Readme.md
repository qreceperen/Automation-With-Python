# Pig Latin

## Rules
1. If a word begins with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u,y) the word 'yay' is added to end of it.
    > airplane = airplaneyay , orange = orangeyay etc.
2. If a word begins with a consonant (every letter except vowels) or consonent cluster like _ch_, _gr_, _rhm_ etc.., constant cluster is moved to the end of word followed by ___ay___. In other words program will look for vowel in the word and move all cluster at the end and add ___ay___. 
    > name = amenay, sweigart = eigartsway. 

3. Program will take sentence, split word by word and check each word vowels.
